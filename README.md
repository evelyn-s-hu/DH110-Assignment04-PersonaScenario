# Assignment 04: Creating Personas and Scenarios

**Course:** DH110 User Interface and Design  
**Description:** Using my prior contextual inquiry and user research, I have created personas and scenarios as a proposal to implement features to make the Washington State Department of Ecology website more accessible.

## The Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling is important in that designers can sometimes forget the fact that they're designing a product for *other people's* usage. When spending a long time tunnel visioning on designing their product to be the best it can be, they may lose sight of who the target audience is and what it is that they actually want from the product. Therefore, UX storytelling helps designers ground themselves by creating personas to better envision how the product should be designed to be the most relevant to the user's needs. Using personas for storytelling helps designers view their product from a different perspective and create a better and improved product.

## Improving the Washington State Department of Ecology Website
**1. Implementing a user portal to keep track of regulations & permits**  
As there are many regulations and permits (4109, to be exact) listed in the portal on the website, it may be difficult to keep track of all of these. Therefore, implementing a user-friendly portal where users can log in, save commonly referenced regulations and permits, be notified of any updates, and be able to easily share links with coworkers would be beneficial to users.  
**2. Improving the "What you can do to reduce greenhouse gases" page**  
As it is now,

## User Scenarios & Journey Maps
### Ralph's Scenario & Journey Map
#### Why Ralph is using this product
> Ralph is the Environmental Manager at his company, which produces a considerable amount of greenhouses gases and other emissions. He needs to ensure the company is responsible for following all of Washington State's regulations and policies; however, there are a great number of such policies that he needs to keep track of, and the policies are constantly changing. As he is getting older, he finds it difficult to stay organized and thinks the website's regulation portal is getting difficult to use as the number of things he needs to stay on top of increases.
#### How Ralph is using this product
> When he gets to work in the morning, Ralph types the full URL, "https://ecology.wa.gov/" into his search bar and presses enter. He first scrolls down to the "News" section of the website to ensure that he is up to date on the latest news regarding the environment. He then clicks the "Regulations & Permits" link to enter the portal, where he is met with a large list of 4109 different regulations and policies. He suddenly forgets which policy he wanted to look up for his work today, so he spends 30 minutes refining his search using the filters on the left side before finding the one he is looking for.
